## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I actually really enjoyed working on the hover elements for this challenge! I assumed the colour was cyan based on the icon, so I rolled with that and figured that the profile name would be a link, but I didn't go overboard with using links since it was mostly testing the hover elements. I wasn't sure if I would need to fix some display things for the eye icon in the view hover, but thankfully I didn't need to do anything with that, which was nice.

I did take a break during this one for lunch, but the overall time spent on it was about an hour since I spent a while figuring out the hover elements, but it was fairly similar code to a previous project with image filters, so it was a simple case of rehashing how I did that.
